MIMOSA requests that any MIMOSA Party or any other party that believes it has patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this MIMOSA Final Deliverable, to notify MIMOSA TC Administrator and provide an indication of its willingness to grant patent licenses to such patent claims in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the MIMOSA Technical Committee that produced this deliverable.

MIMOSA invites any party to contact the MIMOSA TC Administrator if it is aware of a claim of ownership of any patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this MIMOSA Final Deliverable by a patent holder that is not willing to provide a license to such patent claims in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the MIMOSA Technical Committee that produced this MIMOSA Final Deliverable. MIMOSA may include such claims on its website, but disclaims any obligation to do so.

MIMOSA takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in this MIMOSA Final Deliverable or the extent to which any license under such rights might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it has made any effort to identify any such rights. Information on MIMOSA's procedures with respect to rights in any document or deliverable produced by a MIMOSA Technical Committee can be found on the MIMOSA website. Copies of claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this MIMOSA Final Deliverable, can be obtained from the MIMOSA TC Administrator. MIMOSA makes no representation that any information or list of intellectual property rights will at any time be complete, or that any claims in such list are, in fact, Essential Claims.
